        Service name: Sales<br />
        Provides logic and limited process-centric services. Many of its method calls are simply routed directly through to the Data service (which is not accessed directly by any client software).<br />
        But most logic for total service time required, appropriate status to apply to a quote, and which items and quantities to send in supplier purchase orders is done within the Sales service.
